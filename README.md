# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a Python terminal game. I's been deployed on Heroki and runs in the Code Institute mock terminal.

Within this terminal, once users have run the program, they will can play to the clasic Rock, Paper and Scissors game against the computer.

Users must enter their user name and the number of rounds they want to play before start the game.

After playing the chosen rounds ny the user, the final score will be printed out with the due winner. In order to restart the game, the program must be re-run again.
